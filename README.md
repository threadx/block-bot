# Block Bot
Configuration files to block bots from accessing your site.

## Overview

This repo has the setting files for NGNIX and Apache used to prevent bots and spiders from accessing your site. This will help you several ways:

1. With referral spam, you get 100% bounce back. This may be impacting your SEO ratings if Google uses these metrics. 
2. With analytic spiders, your competition will not be able to analyze your link profile and other site characteristics causing you to rank higher than them in the SERPs.

TODO: Apache - I've switched over to NGINX, so if anyone wants to fork this to help out, please do so.
